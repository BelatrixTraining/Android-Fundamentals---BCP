Lorem Ipsum has been the industry\'s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</string>

    <string name="lake_discription">
        Lake Tahoe is a large freshwater lake in the Sierra Nevada of the United States. At a surface
        elevation of 6,225 ft (1,897 m), it straddles the border between California and Nevada, west
        of Carson City. Lake Tahoe is the largest alpine lake in North America. Its depth is
        1,645 ft (501 m), making it the second deepest in the United States after Crater Lake
        (1,945 ft (593 m)). Additionally, Lake Tahoe is the sixth largest lake by volume in the
        United States at 122,160,280 acre·ft (150,682,490 dam3), behind the five Great Lakes.

The lake was formed about 2 million years ago and is a part of the Lake Tahoe Basin with the modern
        lake being shaped during the ice ages. It is known for the clarity of its water and the
        panorama of surrounding mountains on all sides. The area surrounding the lake is also
        referred to as Lake Tahoe, or simply Tahoe. More than 75 percent of the lakes watershed is
        national forest land, comprising the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit of the United States
        Forest Service.
